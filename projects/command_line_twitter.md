The first solution I found for this was [Twirssi](http://twirssi.com/). This is a plug in for the irc client I use called irssi. It is pretty good, but, as I'm not familiar with Perl, I kept running into problems installing it.

I know there are some solutions that plug into emacs, but just for fun, I thought I'd write a little Python script that does what I need. You can find it on [my github page](http://github.com/adamcheasley/twpy).
