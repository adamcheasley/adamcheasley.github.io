    <h1>Adam Forsythe-Cheasley</h1>
    <h2>Software Developer</h2>

    <p class="mt">I am a freelance full stack software developer from Bristol, UK. I have over 15 years' experience in software engineering. I have built everything from complex web apps, through large ecommerce stores to simple, elegant brochureware sites. I have created bespoke mobile apps using React native and Ionic. I have deployed and configured servers, written ansible pipelines, created application builds, written entire backend systems from scratch, through to frontend logic with javaScript frameworks and UI using HTML5 and CSS (sass).</p>

    <p>If you are building any type of system that interacts with the web, or have an idea for a mobile app, then I can help you achieve your vision. Development can be done on a fixed-fee or hourly/daily rate from your company's offices or remotely. See below for ways to get in touch, or just email adam dot forsythecheasley at gmail dot com.</p>
