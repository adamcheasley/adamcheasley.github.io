<p>The first solution I found for this was <a href="http://twirssi.com/">Twirssi</a>. This is a plug in for the irc client I use called irssi. It is pretty good, but, as I’m not familiar with Perl, I kept running into problems installing it.</p>

<p>I know there are some solutions that plug into emacs, but just for fun, I thought I’d write a little Python script that does what I need. You can find it on <a href="http://github.com/adamcheasley/twpy">my github page</a>.</p>
