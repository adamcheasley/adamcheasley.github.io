    <h1>About this site.</h1>

    <p>Before facebook. Before google was the first stop on any web browsing session. Before instagram, twitter and <insert news site of your choice>, there was just the web.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the time, you didn't know where you were, who owned the site or what the hell was going on. Maybe you just followed a link from a friend's "links" page. Maybe you'd stumbled across the page because you were 15 pages deep in a search engine (yes it used to be that hard to find stuff back then).
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted this site to be somewhere one could explore. It would contain a wide variety of images, words etc. and one could get lost for a while. You might stumble onto something as if searching through a second hand shop or an attic. I hope you enjoy.
