    <h1>Someplace Nice</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Adam. You may also know me as Red.<p>

    <h2>I like to make things</h2>
    <p>I have made, or helped make a wide variety of things over the course of my life. I have made digital democracy tools with
    <a href="https://delib.net">Delib</a>. They are a great company. I have also worked on open source projects, including
    <a href="https://github.com/plone/plone.api">plone.api</a>.
    </p>
    <p> I also make art. Mostly paintings. You can see some of
    them at <a href="https://www.redrickstevens.com">redrickstevens.com</a>. I used to take a lot of photographs. I guess I
    would describe what I used to do as "street photography". You can see
    some of my favourites on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/someplacenice/">Flickr</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At University, I studied Music and Visual Art. I made a lot of music during this period of my life.
      You can hear a few of my favourite pieces on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adamfc-music">SoundCloud</a>.
      This also includes a piece by the band <a href="https://carlwhitemusic.bandcamp.com">Carl White</a>,
      of which I was an original member.
