description: Recently I happened to stumble across an NP-Hard problem whilst working on a web app. This problem turned out to be extremely interesting to work on. In this post I talk about the problem and why it's so interesting to hack on.

A few months ago I was freelancing at a company and got handed a ticket to fix. The title seemed pretty innocuous; 'Stop labels overlapping'. The labels to which the title referred were in a generated image. The image was generated from an interactive map like interface. The best way to think of this is imagine trying to print a google map. "Ok", I thought, "sounds fairly straight forward!".
