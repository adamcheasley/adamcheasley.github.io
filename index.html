        <h1>I'm a front-end developer who cares.</h1>

        <p>
            I make websites that work. Like, properly work - for everyone. That means fast, accessible, good looking, and built with actual care. No div soup, no JavaScript bloat, no design trends from a cursed Pinterest board.
        </p>

        <p>
            I focus on front-end development because it's where the magic happens: interfaces, interactions, stuff people actually <em>see</em> and <em>use</em>. I care a lot about accessibility — not as a box-ticking exercise, but because I want sites to be usable by as many people as possible, in the real world, on all devices, with slow connections, with screen readers, with life happening around them.
        </p>

        <p>
            That said, I'm not allergic to the back end. I can build the stuff that powers your site too — databases, APIs, server logic — any essential machinery that keeps things ticking along.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've worked on everything from artist portfolios to e-commerce setups to democracy platforms to weird little web toys. Whether you're looking for clean, human-focused code, or you just want something that doesn't break when you sneeze on it — I can help.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools I Like</h2>
        <p>
            I write semantic HTML like it's 2008. If I want to feel fancy, I'll write a Sass one-liner that does six things at once. React when it's worth it. Vanilla JS when it's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            For back end stuff, I reach for Python. It's fast to write, easy to reason about, and doesn't make me feel like I'm building a nuclear reactor just to serve an API.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also very comfortable in AWS — EC2, S3, Lambda, you name it. I've shipped production stuff that runs there and doesn't fall over.
