    <h1>Someplace Nice</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Adam. You may also know me as Red. I'm an artist and engineer.<p>

    <h2>I like to make things</h2>
    <p>I have made, or helped make a wide variety of things over the course of my life. I have made digital democracy tools with
    <a href="https://delib.net">Delib</a>. They are a great company. I have also worked on open source projects, including
    <a href="https://github.com/plone/plone.api">plone.api</a>.
    </p>
    <p> I also make art. Mostly paintings. You can see some of
    them at <a href="https://www.redrickstevens.com">redrickstevens.com</a>. I used to take a lot of photographs. I guess I
    would describe what I used to do as "street photography". You can see
    some of my favourites on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/someplacenice/">Flickr</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At University, I studied Music and Visual Art. I made a lot of music during this period of my life. I'm currrently
      releasing music under the moniker <a href="https://nullhorizon.bandcamp.com/releases">Null Horizon</a>.
      You can hear a few of my older pieces on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adamfc-music">SoundCloud</a>.
      This also includes a piece by the band <a href="https://carlwhitemusic.bandcamp.com">Carl White</a>,
      of which I was an original member.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've recently been working on a computer game. This is an
      <a href="https://audioadventuregame.com">audio adventure game</a> set in the future. It's still in development, at the
      moment, but hopefully soon it will be playable through the web.
    </p>
    <p>Back in the physical world, I also recently finished a project to build a
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CV0EzugsUY_/">Cabin</a>. The interior still needs finishing, but I'm really
      happy with how it turned out.
    </p>

    <h3>I curate too</h3>
    <p>I sometimes make mixtapes. You can find them on <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/redrickstevens/">mixcloud</a>.</p>
    <p>I also run an online gallery. You can see that on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/someplacenice.gallery/">@someplacecnice.gallery</a></p>
