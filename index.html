  <h1>I'm a front-end developer who cares.</h1>

  <p>
    I make websites that work. Like, properly work - for everyone. That means fast, accessible, good looking, and built with actual care. No div soup, no JavaScript bloat, no design trends from a cursed Pinterest board.
  </p>

  <p>
    I focus on front-end development because it's where the magic happens: interfaces, interactions, stuff people actually <em>see</em> and <em>use</em>. I care a lot about accessibility — not as a box-ticking exercise, but because I want sites to be usable by as many people as possible, in the real world, on all devices, with slow connections, with screen readers, with life happening around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    That said, I'm not allergic to the back end. I can build the stuff that powers your site too — databases, APIs, server logic — any essential machinery that keeps things ticking along.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked on everything from artist portfolios to e-commerce setups to democracy platforms to weird little web toys. Whether you're looking for clean, human-focused code, or you just want something that doesn't break when you sneeze on it — I can help.
