        <h1>I'm a front-end developer who cares <span aria-hidden="true">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></h1>

        <p>
            I make websites that work. Like, properly work - for everyone. That means fast, accessible, good looking, and built with actual care. No div soup, no JavaScript bloat, no design trends from a cursed Pinterest board.
        </p>

        <p>
            I focus on front-end development because it's where the magic happens: interfaces, interactions, stuff people actually <em>see</em> and <em>use</em>. I care a lot about accessibility ‚Äî not as a box-ticking exercise, but because I want sites to be usable by as many people as possible, in the real world, on all devices, with slow connections, with screen readers, with life happening around them.
        </p>

        <p>
            That said, I'm not allergic to the back end. I can build the stuff that powers your site too ‚Äî databases, APIs, server logic ‚Äî any essential machinery that keeps things ticking along.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've worked on everything from artist portfolios to e-commerce setups to democracy platforms to weird little web toys. Whether you're looking for clean, human-focused code, or you just want something that doesn't break when you sneeze on it ‚Äî I can help.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools I Like <span aria-hidden="true">üõ†Ô∏è</span></h2>
        <p>
            I write semantic HTML like it's 2008. If I want to feel fancy, I'll write a Sass one-liner that does six things at once. React when it's worth it. Vanilla JS when it's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            For back end stuff, I reach for Python. It's fast to write, easy to reason about, and doesn't make me feel like I'm building a nuclear reactor just to serve an API.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also very comfortable in AWS ‚Äî EC2, S3, Lambda, you name it. I've shipped production stuff that runs there and doesn't fall over.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Accessibility Work for a Democracy Platform</h3>
            <p class="description">
                I've been leading accessibility improvements for Delib, a company that builds democratic participation tools.
                I kicked off a full front-end audit with an external WCAG specialist, then went through every defect they found and fixed it.
                Some UI components got rebuilt entirely ‚Äî cleaner markup, better ARIA patterns, keyboard-friendly by default.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I'm still making ongoing improvements as the product evolves. The goal is simple: everything should be usable by everyone.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Full-Stack Build for an Mentoring Platform</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Built an entire e-mentoring platform from scratch ‚Äî front end, back end, the works. Custom UI, responsive design, user accounts, all of it.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Also designed and built an in-app messaging system with moderation tools baked in.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>UI/UX Optimisation for an E-Commerce Store</h3>
            <p class="description">
                    Worked with an online store to improve how users actually <em>use</em> the site ‚Äî not just how it looks. Ran A/B tests to figure out what helped people check out faster, find what they needed, and stick around longer.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                    Made a bunch of UI changes based on the results: layout tweaks, better navigation, simpler forms. Cleaned up the experience without adding noise.
