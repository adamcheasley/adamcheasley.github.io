(i) Squares which are composed of only two distinct digits seem to be very common:  
16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 225, 400, 441, 484...  
Show how to construct infinitely many. 

(ii) Squares which are comosed of only two distinct non-zero digits are somewhat rarer. Here they are up to 10^14:  
16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 121, 144, 225, 441, 484, 676, 1444, 7744, 11881, 29929, 44944, 55225, 69696, 9696996, 6661661161.  
Are there infinitely many?
