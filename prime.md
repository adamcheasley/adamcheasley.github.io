## Prime Birthdays
The idea of prime Birthdays came to me whilst I was contemplating why we deem some of our Birthdays more important than others. For example in this country, we deem the following Birthdays as "special":  
13, 16, 18, 21, 30, 40, 50, etc. 

Of course I can see why 18 might be cause for a bigger celebration than usual and some of the others make some sense, but why 30? Why 40? This led me to the idea of assigning significance to a Birthday based on some other property of the number. The obvious choice was prime numbers. The beauty of this system is that when you are young, and Birthdays are a big deal, you have many prime birthdays. As you get older, you have fewer and fewer "special" Birthdays, as shown by the prime number theorem.
